## General info
This is a version of the board game Sternhalma aka Chinese Checkers in which the board resembles the underlying data structure (a 2-dimensional array) more instead of the normal board which is a regular 6 pointed star. Normal board view will become available later. For now the bots are greedy and always go for the longest move. In this version players are restricted from landing in opposing players' end zones, but they are not restricted from jumping through them.
