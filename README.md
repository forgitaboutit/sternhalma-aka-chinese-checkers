## General Info
This version of Sternhalma (aka Chinese Checkers) displays a 2nd board which resembles the underlying data structure, a 2-dimensional array. The JavaScript code that runs the app is also displayed on the page. For now the bots always choose the longest move (randomly choosing between moves of max distance). In this version players are restricted from landing in opposing players' end zones, but they are not restricted from jumping through them.
