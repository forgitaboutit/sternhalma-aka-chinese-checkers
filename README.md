## General info
This is a version of the board game Sternhalma aka Chinese Checkers that shows a 2nd board which resembles the underlying data structure, a 2-dimensional array. For now the bots are greedy and always go for the longest move. In this version players are restricted from landing in opposing players' end zones, but they are not restricted from jumping through them.
